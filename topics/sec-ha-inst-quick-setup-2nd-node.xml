 <title>Adding the Second Node</title>
 <para> If you have a one-node cluster up and running, add the second cluster
  node with the <command>ha-cluster-join</command> bootstrap script, as
  described in <xref linkend="pro-ha-inst-quick-setup-ha-cluster-join"
   xrefstyle="select:label nopage"/>. The script only needs access to an
  existing cluster node and will complete the basic setup on the current machine
  automatically. For details, refer to the <command>ha-cluster-join</command>
  man page. </para>
 <para> The bootstrap scripts take care of changing the configuration specific
  to a two-node cluster, for example, SBD and Corosync. </para>

   <para> Log in as <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> to the
    physical or virtual machine supposed to join the cluster. </para>

   <para> Start the bootstrap script by executing: </para>
   <screen><prompt role="root">root # </prompt><command>ha-cluster-join</command></screen>
   <para> If NTP has not been configured to start at boot time, a message
    appears. The script also checks for a hardware watchdog device (which is
    important in case you want to configure SBD) and warns you if none is
    present. </para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para> If you decide to continue anyway, you will be prompted for the IP
    address of an existing node. Enter the IP address of the first node
     (<systemitem class="server">alice</systemitem>, <systemitem
     class="ipaddress">192.168.1.1</systemitem>). </para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para> If you have not already configured a passwordless SSH access between
    both machines, you will also be prompted for the <systemitem
     class="username">root</systemitem> password of the existing node. </para>
   <para> After logging in to the specified node, the script will copy the
    Corosync configuration, configure SSH and Csync2, and will bring the current
    machine online as new cluster node. Apart from that, it will start the
    service needed for Hawk2. <!--
     If you have configured shared storage with OCFS2, it will also
     automatically create the mount point directory for the OCFS2 file system.
     -->

 <para> Check the cluster status in Hawk2. Under <menuchoice>
   <guimenu>Status</guimenu>
   <guimenu>Nodes</guimenu>
  </menuchoice> you should see two nodes with a green status (see <xref
