  <title>Usage Scenario</title>
  <para> The procedures in this document will lead to a minimal setup of a
    two-node cluster with the following properties: </para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para> Two nodes: <systemitem class="server">alice</systemitem> (IP:
          <systemitem class="ipaddress">192.168.1.1</systemitem>) and
          <systemitem class="server">bob</systemitem> (IP: <systemitem
          class="ipaddress">192.168.1.2</systemitem>), connected to each other
        via network. </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para> A floating, virtual IP address (<systemitem class="ipaddress"
          >192.168.2.1</systemitem>) which allows clients to connect to the
        service no matter which physical node it is running on. </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>A shared storage device, used as SBD fencing mechanism. This avoids
        split brain scenarios. </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para> Failover of resources from one node to the other if the active host
        breaks down (<emphasis>active/passive</emphasis> setup). </para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para> After setup of the cluster with the bootstrap scripts, we will monitor
    the cluster with the graphical HA Web Konsole (Hawk), one of the cluster
    management tools included with <phrase role="roductnamereg"><phrase
        os="sles">SUSEÂ® Linux Enterprise High Availability
      Extension</phrase></phrase>. As a basic test of whether failover of
    resources works, we will put one of the nodes into standby mode and check if
    the virtual IP address is migrated to the second node. </para>
  <para> You can use the two-node cluster for testing purposes or as a minimal
    cluster configuration that you can extend later on. Before using the cluster
    in a production environment, modify it according to your requirements.
